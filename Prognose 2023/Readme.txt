Hello!
In this folder, You will only find the R-code for the Shinyapp to Analyze the results of the official Austrian 
population projection (2023-2100). Compared to the App of 2022, there are more features now, all the Variants from
last years' forecast are available for comparison as well as age distribution of immigrants, emigrants, deaths and
age of mothers at birth.
All the data is available, just not on github as the data files are too large. If You want, you can just write me 
and I will send them to You.
